## Adding an item to the awesome list

To add something to the list, create a PR that adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Suggested packages should be tested and documented.
-  Toy/ BATA (Build and throw away) projects are not allowed. Side projects are ok to be added if they help users to achieve a use case (they should be under Community Tools).
- The pull request should have a meaningful title and include a link to the package / resource and why it's awesome.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[resource](link) - Description.`
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Link to the GitHub repo, not npmjs.com.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

Thank you for your suggestions!
